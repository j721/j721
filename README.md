### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Julia! I'm a full stack developer who loves having my creative and inventive ideas come to life in my projects, and being able to share them with others. I love working in a team, getting to build an amazing product together, and having the opportunity to learn and grow from my peers.
